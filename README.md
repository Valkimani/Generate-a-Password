# Generate-a-Password

## Description

This project demonstrates how to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected. A starter code was provided for modifications and Javascript was created from scratch. The task is to ensure the app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. The end result is a responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## To achieve this

To create a strong password that provides great security for sensitive data, the applications has been coded with different functions.
1.The user must use charaters.
2.The user must use a criteria.
3.The pasword mut meet a certain length.
4.The final password should populate in the text placeholder.

## To chieve this

1.When the generate button is clicked, the user is prompted to act on some actions.
2.Prompts to inform the user what was required for a password length and criteria
3.Confirms were used to get the users choice of character and pasword length.
4.If & else statements were used to compare possible outcomes from the user.
