# Generate-a-Password

## Description

This project demonstrates how to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected. A start code was provided for modifications and Javascript was created from scratch. The task is ensure the app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. The end result is a responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).
